# click-counter
This is a simple game where the player has to click a button as many times as possible within a given time limit of 5 seconds. The game starts when the player clicks the button and a timer starts counting down from 5 seconds. The player's click count is displayed in a text area. When the time limit is reached, the game ends and the player is shown a "Game Over" message. After a 2 second delay, the text area is reset to display two sunglasses emojis and the game can be played again by clicking the button.
